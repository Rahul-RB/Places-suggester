{'ChIJk2LTtBAWrjsR9op2pBJdYZk': ['As far as I had heard, this place heavily crowded but when I visited the restaurant, the crowd was a little less than usual. The food was amazing. The taste of the dose is unique and so is the colour (they serve orange colour dose here). The coffee was yum. It was a lovely experience. Will definitely go back!', 'Soup was borderline ok. Felt like sugar was added to sweet corn soup. \nDishes were good with right proportion of spices. Curry leaves in noodles came as a surprise to us though. \n\nKeep blending :)', "Unusual approach and very difficult to park. Inside it can get stuffy on the ground floor. The a/c hall on the first floor has wooden paneling. The tables are not cleaned and can be sticky, even the menu cards. The prices are a little on the higher side,  e.g: the south Indian meal costs ₹245, 3 rotis and a curry can cost ₹220 to ₹300. Cuisines offered include South Indian, chats, North Indian, and Chinese. The plates weren't very clean either. My plate wasn't clean even after I used a tissue to wipe it. The food was pretty good however, and the meals are very filling. The bill comes with meetha paan and somf. Washrooms are alright, not spectacular but alright.", "One of the old restaurants in Bangalore. Also known as Hotel Chalukya.

Recommend visiting the place during non-peak hours.', 'Though food is spicy hot but not so spicy hot (as per Andhra standard where I was born and brought up), I have given up spicy hot food since a long time.

If you want to treat yourself to some decent new style of Chinese cooking, this is the place. You might be surprised to find new dishes here that are really delicious. The owner is friendly guy and offers best meal advise. You will keep coming here for more. Cilantro chicken / prawn , 3 spice chick gravy, Garlic fried rice are absolute favorites for me.', 'Authentic Kolkata style chinese cuisine. Loved the chicken manchurian.'], 'ChIJQz3mlkMUrjsRHhq5nXchOD4': ["Amazing service and ambience, the waiters are very friendly and tend to your needs immediately. The quickness and quality of service is appreciated. The hotel has great eating space; it's neat and well organized. The food is amazing and every thing we ordered was delicious, complete worth for money in terms of quantity and taste. Right outside the hotel there is a tea shop, if you're not in the mood for a meal you can just have a cup of mouth watering hot tea.

It has very small place to sit & eat. only 4 or 5 tables of 4 chairs. Cook keeps changing all the time. Tandoori is ok for the price he charges. I would recommend this place as the last option, if you are so hungry & no other place around.', 'Tasty food, economical, mostly take-away, limited seating capacity. Stick to Indian dishes for better taste.', 'Good non veg options. Better to carry out food.

They just ruined their brand name in no time with their poor quality.", "This is assumed to be one of the best Andra restaurant. Unfortunately it's not.!!\n\nAmbience is not good.

Suffered from stomach problems for a day.. food was good and cost is normal for multicuisine restaurant..', "They named it as a Rayalaseema Restaurant but that doesn't mean that food has to be so spicy that you will be even afraid to taste it.If they reduce the spice a bit then it may improve in serving and attracting meat Lovers.", 'Great food.

Who can imagine that a place tucked in a small corner of one of the busiest road /lanes connecting Bannerghatta road can provide you with a gourmet experience? This is a hidden gem in this part of the town. I am actually surprised, how people still have not crowded this place like any other places in Bangalore? The place is on the terrace of a service apartment in residential area (though on the main road). You may find it difficult to locate. Parking can be an issue but being residential area, I am sure you would get some place to park your car. In this regards, if you have a choice, choose your smaller car here in place of your long big luxury sedan 😂. The food is very good and quite different from the routine "multi - cuisine" restaurants. Though, meat lovers would be extremely happy but there are enough options for the vegetarians too. Wood Fire pizzas are quite nice. In fact, order anything and you won\'t go wrong. I would certainly recommend this place for a family dinner or a romantic dinner or a quiet lunch too!', "Wonderful place to visit in all seasons expect rainy. Kinda open place with awesome breeze.

Food is great. Sizzlers, Risotto & Pastas are pretty good. I felt quantity could be a little more for the dishes but it wasn't too less or inadequate, so no big deal. \n\nFor the quality and taste for your money, I would recommend this place.\n\nPre-book a table if you're planning to visit on a weekend evening as the place can be crowded and you will have to join the waiting-list if you show up without a booking.", 'Better to come to this place in the evening. It can get quite warm in the afternoon. Food is good and the ambience is youngster friendly. Ventilation and lighting in afternoon can be made better'], 'ChIJTVXavtQVrjsRwM0ubybRNdA': ['Used rooms for 3 days which is value for money, Restaurant is known for Pork and Chinese dishes.', 'Lovely old world place serving mostly Mangalorean cuisine.

Awesome place for non vegetarians wide variety of food', 'Felt bit a costlier than other places but food is good for who like more Natty style'], 'ChIJ8bynR44UrjsR5SB6ZSgkHQ0': ['Silent place with good ambience. The old style chair, seeling, lights, lamps, sofa every detail is looked into consideration. Even the salt and pepper stand too is shaped as a boat. Liked the ambience. Would have been good if the fish quantity was more in fish meal.', 'I visited this restaurant together with some locals. Overall I really enjoyed the food. \n\nWe had various small plates to share. From fish over meat to veg. Everything was tasty but to be hones nothing to special or fancy which is ok for the price point. \n\nThe service was fast and nice. However I found the interior and ambience  a little bit outdated and there was kind of a strange smell. \n\nOverall I would recommend to go there.', "Have been visiting this place regularly and I find the place degrading every visit. We visited on a Sunday and were told that they were closed on Sundays for last 9 months and recently resumed Sunday operations. Maybe because of this , the waiters we're not interested to serve on Sundays since they lost their holidays!! \nNo one bothered to ask us as to whether we want anything and all were busy with their mobiles.
